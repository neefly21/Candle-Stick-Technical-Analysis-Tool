# Candle-Stick-Technical-Analysis-Tool
Project that is 100% inspired by Part-Time Larry on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/c/parttimelarry) as I have slowly become more interested in applying my software interests to my budding interest in finanace and investing.

Project requires being compiled via NPM

In the client-app directory run 'npm install'
then                            'npm run-script start' to begin listening for changes to your react.
