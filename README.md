# Candle-Stick-Technical-Analysis-Tool
Porting over the project created by Part-Time-Larry completing an identical project in Python.

This project is 100% inspired by YouTuber 'Part-Time-Larry' who creates amazing videos on trading/investing and the tools you can write for these areas!

The project is a dot net port of his Python technical analysis tool with a few modifications given the differences in language syntax/1000 ways to do something.

Project requires being compiled via NPM

In the client-app directory run 'npm install'
then                            'npm run-script start' to begin listening for changes to your react.
